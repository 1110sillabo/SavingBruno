## TODOs

- [ ] Speeder's dungeon needs polishing;
- [ ] Battle's difficulty and level curves require more testing;
- [ ] Items and gears are mainly placeholders;
- [ ] There's a shop in the main village map, it needs to be built;
- [ ] Standard slimer troop should become a **semicolon**;
- [ ] in general, more Pythonista stuff should appear in the game;
- [ ] all the outside world after getting Speeder is a big placeholder.

## Disclamair

Yes, I know the BDFL is called Guido and not Bruno. Same for Spyder (Speeder) and (Ana)Conda.


## RPG Maker VX Resources

There are a few resources out there to get started with RPG Maker (VX):
